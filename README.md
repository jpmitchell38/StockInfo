# StockInfo

This project asks the user for a list of stocks, and how many days back do you want to grab data from. It fetches the data then has an output of four graphs. Closing Price vs Time, Closing Price vs Volume, Volume Vs Time, High-Low Range vs Time.  

(LINK SCREENSHOTS)

## How Its Made:

Tech used: Python, HTML, CSS

I used python for the backend part of the project, where I can connect to the yahoo finance api and grab data about a stock that way. Its also where I generate the graph where the html file grabs it. The html file organizes areas into divs so im able to style them with css. 

## How to Run

git clone --

cd into directory (StockInfo0)

pip install -r requirements.txt

python StockMain.py

go to the url it gives you
